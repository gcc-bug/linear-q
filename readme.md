# Quantum Linear Synthesis

## Description
Quantum Linear Synthesis is a project focused on synthesizing quantum circuits, with a primary optimization goal of reducing the CNOT count for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. This is crucial for advancing quantum computing efficiency and reliability.

## Installation of Dependencies
