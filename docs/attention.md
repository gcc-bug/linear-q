# Iterating Over Elements in C++: Value vs. Reference

When iterating over a collection of objects in C++, such as a `vector`, we have the option to iterate by value or by reference. This choice significantly impacts whether we can modify the original objects in the collection. Grasping this difference is crucial for effective C++ programming.

## By Value

Iterating by value means creating a **copy** of each element in the collection. Any modifications are applied to these copies, not the original objects.

### Syntax
```cpp
for(auto element : collection) {
    // Modifications here affect only the copy of each element, not the original.
}
```

### Implications
- This method is safe when we only need to read from each element without modifying them.
- It can be inefficient for large objects due to the overhead of copying.
## By Reference
Iterating by reference allows direct access to each element in the collection. Any modifications made are reflected in the original collection.

### Syntax
```cpp
for(auto& element : collection) {
    // Modifications here affect the original elements in the collection.
}
```
### Implications
- It's necessary to iterate by reference when we need to modify the elements in the collection.
- More efficient than iterating by value, especially for large objects, as no copying is involved.
## Summary
- Iterate by value when modifications to the elements are not needed or when working with small, simple objects where the copy overhead is negligible.
- Iterate by reference when modifications to the elements are required or when working with large objects to avoid the overhead of copying.

Understanding and choosing the correct iteration method based on our needs is key to writing efficient and effective C++ code.
